				<p>Our friends Mina and Avi were getting married,
					and they needed to invite people for their big day.
					We build a dual language website for them. </p><p class="resetparagrap">People were able to get invited,
						RSVP, get the location, plan their trip,
						find accommodation and find other information for the event.
						Also, we turned the website's design into a print invitation for all non-tech-savvy people.
